# E2E Testing

We can do the end-to-end testing for the latest CoinflectJS by setting up a local Coinflect network and running the `e2e_tests` in the root directory.

## Setup Local Coinflect Network

For testing end to end, you need to have a local network running. This can easily be achieved by using Coinflect Network Runner. You can follow the steps [here](https://docs.coinflect.com/quickstart/network-runner) to setup a local network.

## Setup Environment Variables

You need to add IP and PORT of the node running the local network to your environment variables. Run the following command according to your setup:

```bash
COINFLECTCHAIN_IP=0.0.0.0
COINFLECTCHAIN_PORT=9650
```

## Run Tests

The following command will start the E2E testing

```
yarn test -i --roots e2e_tests
```
